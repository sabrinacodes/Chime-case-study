### Chime Case Study
Chime is a technology company that offers digital banking options for people on the go. Chris Britt and Ryan King created Chime in 2013. Chime provides fee-free financial services through a mobile app. Their competitors are Ally Bank, Varo, and Axos Bank. 

Chime operates an app that allows its users to create checking and savings accounts, as well as offering a debit card in partnership with Visa. Instead of charging account fees, Chime makes money by taking a portion of the transactions, fees that Visa charges merchants when customers use Chime’s debit card. Chime earns the majority of its revenue from the collection of the interchange. Interchange is the fee that banks charge to the merchant who processes a credit card or debit card payment in order to cover the costs associated with the authorization and processing of card transactions. An interchange, based revenue model means that profitability is contingent on successfully incentivizing customers to regularly make card purchase transactions.

Chime makes banking convenient for people not able to get a traditional bank account. It takes less than 2 minutes to open an account. Their customers are able to access account information and make changes through the app. Some of the strengths of Chime are an alternative to traditional banking, no hidden fees, and early wage access.  And their weaknesses are no branch locations, use third party to deposit money, and limited services.

As of December 2019, Chime had 6.5 million accounts, up from 1 million the previous year. It is important to note, however, that because many customers have both checking and savings accounts, and some accounts may be inactive, its number of customers is lower. According to Crunchbase, Chime has raised $808.8 million dollars over 7 funding rounds, the most recent of which was on December 5, 2019. As of that latest fundraising round, Chime was valued at $5.8 billion with an estimated $300 million in revenue, giving it a price-to-sales ratio of 20.
Chime plans to launch a new, free feature to help users boost their credit scores next year, says CEO Chris Britt, although he declined to provide details. He also plans to launch a credit card in the first half of 2020 and eventually move into personal loans. After that, he’ll launch investment services, such as low-fee exchange-traded funds and retirement services, potentially in 2021. Britt is also considering installment loans, where people can finance purchases in periodic payments.
